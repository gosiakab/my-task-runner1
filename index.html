            We had goldfish and they circled around and around in the bowl <br />
            on the table near the heavy drapes covering the picture window and my
            mother,<br />
            always smiling, wanting us all to be happy, told me, ‘be happy
            Henry!’<br />
            and she was right: it’s better to be happy if you can but my father
            <br />
            continued to beat her and me several times a week while raging
            inside<br />
            his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn’t understand what was attacking
            <br />

              him from within. my mother, poor fish, wanting to be happy, beaten two
              <br />  
            or three times a week, telling me to be happy: ‘Henry, smile! <br />
            why don’t you ever smile?’ and then she would smile, to show me how,
            <br />
            and it was the saddest smile I ever saw one day the goldfish died,<br />
            all five of them, they floated on the water, on their sides,<br />
            their eyes still open, and when my father got home he threw them
            <br />
            to the cat there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
            smiled
